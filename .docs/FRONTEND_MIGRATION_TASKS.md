2. **Implement incrementally** - One feature at a time
3. **Test thoroughly** - Each component before moving on
4. **Document changes** - Update README and component docs
5. **Review and refactor** - Apply SOLID principles

### Code Standards
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Follow established naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Write self-documenting code
- Add TypeScript-like JSDoc comments

### Testing Strategy
- Unit test all components and services
- Integration test user workflows
- E2E test critical user journeys
- Performance test image-heavy operations
