# Image Sharing System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the ImageShare application's user sharing system to address the issue of non-unique usernames and improve the overall user experience.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Non-Unique Usernames
- **Issue**: Usernames were not unique, making it difficult to identify specific users for sharing
- **Impact**: Users could not reliably share content with specific individuals
- **Solution**: Made usernames unique in the database and added validation

### 2. Poor User Selection Interface
- **Issue**: Users had to manually type usernames, leading to errors and frustration
- **Impact**: Sharing was error-prone and time-consuming
- **Solution**: Created an intuitive user selection interface with search and visual selection

### 3. Limited User Discovery
- **Issue**: Users couldn't easily discover other users to share with
- **Impact**: Reduced social interaction and content sharing
- **Solution**: Added user browsing and profile viewing capabilities

## Technical Improvements
